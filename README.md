# Knoxville Hospital Prices
**Author: Lily Ramsay**   
  
The goal of this project is to incorporate the four major hospitals in Knoxville, TN into a single data set to compare costs for certain hospital procedures. The hospitals evaluated are Turkey Creek Medical Center, Parkwest Medical Center, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, and Blount Memorial Hospital. The data was obtained through each of the hospitals websites. It primarily uses R as an ETL tool but includes SQL statements to build your own SQL tables. Use this code and data at your risk and to your own delight. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:lil@lilyramsay.com) with questions and I will try to be as helpful as possible.   

A partially finished product is available to view [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lily.ramsay/viz/ALookAtKnoxvillePrices/UnderstandingChargeDiscountVariance?publish=yes).
